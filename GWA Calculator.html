<div class="container">
    <h2>Understanding the Philippine Grading System</h2>
    <p>Computing grades in the Philippines can seem complicated, but with a clear understanding of the process, it becomes manageable. This guide will walk you through how grades are calculated in the Philippine education system, covering both basic education (K-12) and higher education. Whether you're a student, parent, or educator, this guide will help you understand the ins and outs of grade computation.</p>

    <h2>K-12 Grading System</h2>
    <p>In basic education, grades are expressed as percentages and correspond to the following descriptors:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>90-100%</strong>: Outstanding</li>
        <li><strong>85-89%</strong>: Very Satisfactory</li>
        <li><strong>80-84%</strong>: Satisfactory</li>
        <li><strong>75-79%</strong>: Fairly Satisfactory</li>
        <li><strong>Below 75%</strong>: Did Not Meet Expectations</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>College and University Grading System</h2>
    <p>Colleges and universities may have slightly different scales, but they generally look like this:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>1.0 - 1.5</strong>: Excellent (90-100%)</li>
        <li><strong>1.75 - 2.0</strong>: Very Good (85-89%)</li>
        <li><strong>2.25 - 2.5</strong>: Good (80-84%)</li>
        <li><strong>2.75 - 3.0</strong>: Satisfactory (75-79%)</li>
        <li><strong>5.0</strong>: Fail (below 75%)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Components of Grades</h2>
    <p><a href="https://gwacalculator.ph/deped-grading-system/">Grades in the Philippines</a> are typically made up of three main components: written works, performance tasks, and quarterly assessments. These components help measure different aspects of student learning and performance.</p>

    <h3>Written Works</h3>
    <p>Written works include quizzes, tests, assignments, and written reports. They usually make up 20-40% of the final grade, depending on the subject.</p>

    <h3>Performance Tasks</h3>
    <p>Performance tasks assess practical skills and application of knowledge. These can be projects, experiments, presentations, or other hands-on activities. Performance tasks often account for 40-60% of the final grade.</p>

    <h3>Quarterly Assessments</h3>
    <p>Quarterly assessments, or periodical exams, measure what students have learned over the term. These exams typically contribute 20-30% to the final grade.</p>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Guide to Computing Grades</h2>
    <p>Let's go through a step-by-step example of how to compute grades using a Grade 10 Science class as an illustration.</p>

    <div class="step">
        <span class="step-number">1</span> <strong>Collect All Scores</strong>
        <p>First, gather all the scores from written works, performance tasks, and quarterly assessments. For example:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Written Works</strong>: Quiz 1 (20/25), Quiz 2 (15/20), Assignment (18/20)</li>
            <li><strong>Performance Tasks</strong>: Project (45/50), Lab Report (40/50)</li>
            <li><strong>Quarterly Assessment</strong>: Periodical Exam (80/100)</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <span class="step-number">2</span> <strong>Calculate the Average for Each Component</strong>
        <p>Convert each score to a percentage and then compute the average for each component.</p>
        <h4>Written Works</h4>
        <p>
            Quiz 1 = 20/25 × 100 = 80% <br>
            Quiz 2 = 15/20 × 100 = 75% <br>
            Assignment = 18/20 × 100 = 90% <br>
            Average Written Works = (80% + 75% + 90%) / 3 = 81.67%
        </p>
        <h4>Performance Tasks</h4>
        <p>
            Project = 45/50 × 100 = 90% <br>
            Lab Report = 40/50 × 100 = 80% <br>
            Average Performance Tasks = (90% + 80%) / 2 = 85%
        </p>
        <h4>Quarterly Assessment</h4>
        <p>
            Quarterly Assessment = 80%
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <span class="step-number">3</span> <strong>Apply Weight Distribution</strong>
        <p>Next, apply the weights to each component. Assume the weights are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Written Works</strong>: 30%</li>
            <li><strong>Performance Tasks</strong>: 50%</li>
            <li><strong>Quarterly Assessment</strong>: 20%</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Weighted Written Works = 81.67% × 0.30 = 24.50% <br>
            Weighted Performance Tasks = 85% × 0.50 = 42.50% <br>
            Weighted Quarterly Assessment = 80% × 0.20 = 16.00%
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <span class="step-number">4</span> <strong>Compute the Final Grade</strong>
        <p>Add the weighted scores to get the final grade:</p>
        <p>Final Grade = 24.50% + 42.50% + 16.00% = 83.00%</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step">
        <span class="step-number">5</span> <strong>Convert to Letter Grade</strong>
        <p>Finally, convert the percentage to a letter grade based on the DepEd scale:</p>
        <p>83.00% falls within the range of 80-84%, which is Satisfactory.</p>
